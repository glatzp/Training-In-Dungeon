Training-In-Dungeon

A small instructional prototype exploring planning-before-execution through a grid-based dungeon game.

What This Explores

This project explores whether requiring learners to plan instructions in advance, observe literal execution, and debug visible failure helps build anticipation, judgment, and revision habits.

In particular, it focuses on:

Planning before execution

Literal instruction-following

Debugging through observable failure

The goal is to externalize thinking so it can be tested, broken, and improved.
