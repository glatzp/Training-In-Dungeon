# Training-In-Dungeon
A small instructional experiment exploring planning-before-execution through a grid-based dungeon game. Students write full instruction sequences for an agent, observe literal execution, debug failures, and iterate. Focused on anticipation, instruction clarity, and revision — not real-time control.
